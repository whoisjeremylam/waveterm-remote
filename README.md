</div>

RemoteTerm is an open-source terminal for macOS, Linux, and Windows. No accounts required.

RemoteTerm supports durable SSH sessions that survive network interruptions and restarts, with automatic reconnection. Edit remote files with a built-in graphical editor and preview files inline without leaving the terminal.

## What's different

This fork is tuned for developers who work on remote machines, with the local app as a thin client.

**Sessions that heal themselves.** Durable SSH sessions survive network drops, laptop sleep/wake, VPN changes, and app restarts. When a connection drops it reconnects automatically.

**Remote work feels local.** Inline images render right in the terminal (Sixel, iTerm2, Kitty). Copy-and-paste screenshots and drag-and-drop files into remote sessions. Review, stage, commit, and push changes on any connected host with the built-in source-control sidebar.

**Your AI agents stay running.** Claude Code, Grok Build, OpenCode, and Pi work in the terminal — durable sessions survive disconnects, irrespective if your local machine is offline and inline images render their output.

**Your SSH config is automatically detected.** `LocalForward` / `RemoteForward` from `~/.ssh/config` are applied automatically — no extra setup.

**Private by default.** Zero telemetry, analytics, and cloud data collection. Always.
